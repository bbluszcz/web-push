This is a 3-in-1 project:

1. A real product for developers to help with understanding how Web Push API works.
2. A real-world demo and a playground for [Web Push API](https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/).
3. Proof of concept for a Progressive Web App (PWA) driven by Workbox-powered service worker.

### Web application (installable, offline-ready)

[Push.Foo](https://push.foo) - Web Push API Playground

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
